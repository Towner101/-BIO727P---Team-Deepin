**DEEPIN GENETICS HUB**
----
A group of MSc Bioinformatics students have collaborated to design Deepin Genetics Hub, a web-based software tool that explores the intricate and complex dimensions of human population genetics. The website demonstrates key analysis such as Principal Component Analysis and ADMIXTURE, along with allele and genenotype frequency comparisons.
